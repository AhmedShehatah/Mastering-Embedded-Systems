## Why I Chose To Learn Embedded 
Embedded Engineers Write Code, But Unlike Software Engineers They Need A Deep Understanding Of The Hardware It Runs On. An Embedded Engineer Knows The Schematics Of Hardware And How Chip Datasheets Relate To The Code Written For Them. They Are Responsible For Designing, Developing, Optimizing And Implementing The Software That Is Programmed Into Devices Built Around A Microprocessor.
