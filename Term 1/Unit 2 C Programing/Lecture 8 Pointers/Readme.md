# Pointers (A very Important Concept in embedded world)

***Pointer***: A pointer is a variable that *<u>holds a memory address.</u>*

***Pointer Size***: Pointers have a *<u>**fixed size**</u>* that depends on CPU architecture and OS.

- For 32Bit machine: pointer size =  4byte

- For 64Bit machine: pointer size = 8byte
  
  

## ***Pointer syntax***

```c
int* px;
// or 
int *px;

// there is no difference between them


// notice this
int *px,py; /// px is a pointer while py is not

```





## **Unary increment operation for the pointer**

```c
int* px = 0x0;
px++; // px = 0x4
```

Important Notes

- Each time pointer is increamented or decreamented it points to the memory location of the next element of its base type e.g. if pointer from type `char` if pointer `char px = 0x0` and me made `px++` now `px = 0x1` and if it's from type `long long` then `px = 0x8` 

- ÔÅµThere are only two arithmetic operations that you can use on pointers: <u>addition </u>and <u>subtraction</u>.  
  
  

- Notice this

 ```c
  int arr[10];
  arr++ // invalid array address is fixed
 ```
  
  ## **Pointer to Strucutre**
  
  there is no difference between normal pointer and pointer to struct the only difference is when you access pointer struct you use `pointer-> member` 
  
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  struct STest
  {
      int age;
      int salary;
  } test;
  int main()
  {
      struct STest *ptest = &test;
  
      ptest->age; // notice this line
  
      return 0;
  }
  ```
  
  

## **Generic Pointers or Unknown Pointers**

  Generic pointer can point to different data types as shown blew

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 10;
    double y = 2.5;
    void *p;
    p = &x;
    *(int *)p = 3;
    printf("%d ", *(int *)p);
    p = &y;
    *(double *)p = 5.2;
    printf("%llf", *(double *)p);
    return 0;
}


```
